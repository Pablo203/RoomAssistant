### Day 9 November 26.2021

**Today's Progress:** I finally finished Alarm functions. Biggest problem were how to run it in background so it wouldn't get in conflict with another functions and doesn't block them

**Thoughts:** It was my biggest problem so far. I'm happy that I solved it. Stackoverflow come in handy in this one and as always
