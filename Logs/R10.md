### Day 9 November 26.2021

**Today's Progress:** Today I plugged in speaker and microphone. It took a while because operating system is strictly for servers and didn't have any gui and I must do that via terminal. Everything works fine for now. 

**Thoughts:** It was hell getting everything work. For tommorow I planned starting to write calendar module.
