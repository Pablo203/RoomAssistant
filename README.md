### RoomAssistant
This whole project was meant to be a project for #100DaysOfCode challenge, but I got attachted to the idea of my own Assistant and kept writing new features. I hope in the end it will be able to be as good as other assistants.


**Before download**

-Python3




 **After download**

 -Run setup.sh
 
 -Fill config.json
 
 -Try running main.py (It might throw error one or two times, then run it again and it should work)

Originally I were writing Assistant for my room but I wanted people to play with it
and have fun. I'm really counting for feedback.
