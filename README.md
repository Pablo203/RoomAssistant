### RoomAssistant
It's project for #100DaysOfCode challenge
Goal is to make three main parts. Currently there is one available to download.
There will be:
-Virtual Assistant only
-Virtual Assistant with website connected to it
-Virtual Assistant with robot schematics


**Before download**
-Python3
-PhpMyAdmin


 **After download**
 -Run setup.sh
 -Fill config.json
 -Try running main.py (It might throw error one or two times, then run it again and it should work)

Originally I were writing Assistant for my room but I wanted people to play with it
and have fun. I'm really counting for feedback.
